Assessment - 1( Session 1)
Using the Titanic_visu.csv file plot the following graphs and state your inference from each of them:

1. Draw a bar chart with Embarked and its count (use different colors for each team)
2. Draw a comparative bar chart for Fare and New_Fare against each person (first 15
persons)
3. Draw a horizontal bar chart for Embarked and Fare

5. Draw a pie chart with Passenger class and its count
6. Draw the dot plot between person and age (first 15 persons)
7. Draw the line plot between Age and Concession. Observe the trend line.
8. Draw the scatter plot between Fare and New_Fare. Observe the correlation
9. Draw the scatter plot between Age and Fare. Observe the correlation
10. Draw the box plot to show the statistical summary of Age column and verify with
describe()
11. Draw the histogram plot for Concession column
12. Draw the histogram plot for Concession column with bin value and PDF
